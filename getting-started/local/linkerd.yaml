  # Incoming requests to linkerd with a Host header of "hello" get assigned a
  # name like /http/1.1/GET/hello.  This dtab transforms that into
  # /#/io.l5d.fs/hello which indicates that the filesystem namer should be used
  # and should look for a file named "hello".  linkerd will then load balance
  # over the entries in that file.
